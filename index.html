      <p> My name is David, Ejiro David and since I have nothing to say about myself I'll just plugin my favourite
        quote, Its one from Ralph Waldo Emerson:<br><br> To laugh often and much;
        to win the respect of the intelligent people
        and the affection of children;
        to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;
        to appreciate beauty;
        to find the best in others;
        to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child,
        a garden patch,
        or a redeemed social condition;
        to know that one life has breathed easier because you lived here.
        This is to have succeeded. </p>
